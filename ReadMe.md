# Statistics Scrapers

This is a repository of the web scrapers I have used to obtain data in Mr. Friedland's AP Statistics course, 2021-2022. It contains a subset of the scrapers that I have used in past projects and that are applicable to most students.

It is being updated with new scripts as the class progresses.

Environment setup requires python as well as BeautifulSoup and Selenium for some scripts. I'm thinking about finding a better way to host this, but in the meantime, happy scraping :)
